&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a research fellow in the Geometry and Representation Theory group led by [Prof. Stéphanie Cupit-Foutou](https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/fakultaet/arbeitsbereiche/analysis-und-topologie/gruppe-cupit-foutou/team/prof-dr-stephanie-cupit-foutou/) at the Ruhr University Bochum.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 2023, I am  a member of two working groups, Cartan Geometry and Representation Theory, and Integrable Systems and Supersymmetry, in the COST Action CaLISTA.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did my PhD under the the supervision of [Prof. David M. J. Calderbank](https://people.bath.ac.uk/dmjc20/) at the University of Bath, and defended my thesis, titled Extremal Kähler metrics and separable toric geometries, in February 2022.

Currently, I work on:
- **Separable geometries**
[Toric separable geometries and extremal Kähler metrics (Nov '25)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01722) introduces the framework of (local) toric separable contact, CR and Kähler geometries which
  - associates a family of toric separable Kähler geometries to each factorization structure / associates a toric CR geometry to each factorization structure,
      - moduli of factorization structures, being typically positive-dimensional, offer huge amounts of separable toric geometries
  - recovers all known explicit extremal toric Kähler metrics as extremal toric separable geometries compatible with _the product Segre_ and _the Veronese_ factorization structues,
  - provides new extremal toric Kähler metrics, coming from toric separable geometries compatible with _the product Segre-Veronese_ factorization structure, a common generalisation of the two from above.
  - In addition, this work initiates the study of extremality for toric separable geometries coming from _decomposable_ factorization structures, being a vast class which trivially includes the above three factorization structures and which has a positive-dimensional moduli. The aim is to obtain a uniform treatment of extremality for these geometries.
2.
The key notion of the separable geometries framework is that of factorization structures, which gives rise to
- **Geometry of compatible cones and polytopes**, where Marie-Charlotte Brandenburg and I explicitly compute their Ehrhart polynomials, volumes, f-vectors and more. This class of polytopes vastly generalises cyclic polytopes and features a generalised Gale's criterium. First article in this series is titled [Veronese polytopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13702).

Beyond my core research, I explore higher geometry and the crystallization conjecture—bridging math with crystal design. Natural sciences captivate me too, especially experimental and theoretical physics. If these pursuits align with yours, let’s connect—I’d be thrilled to exchange ideas!
